**a.To find the movie with the highest average rating.**
select movie_id, avg(rating) as avg_rating
from ratings
group by movie_id
order by avg_rating desc
limit 1;

**b.Identify the most active users based on the number of ratings submitted.**
select user_id, count(*) as num_ratings
from ratings
group by user_id
order by num_ratings desc
limit 10; -- you can adjust the limit as needed

**c.Discover movies with the highest number of positive ratings.**
assuming a positive rating is 4 or 5:
select movie_id, count(*) as positive_ratings
from ratings
where rating >= 4
group by movie_id
order by positive_ratings desc
limit 10; -- you can adjust the limit as needed

**d.Find the top genres ranked by their average rating.**
this step requires joining the movies and ratings tables,
-- explode genres and calculate average ratings for each genre
with exploded_genres as (
select movie_id, explode(split(genres, '[|]')) as genre
from movies
),
genre_ratings as (
select g.genre, avg(r.rating) as avg_rating
from exploded_genres g
join ratings r on g.movie_id = r.movie_id
group by g.genre
)
select genre, avg_rating
from genre_ratings
order by avg_rating desc;
